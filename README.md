**Notes for the reader**

This project focuses on implementing an associative array, a data structure that allows for the storage and retrieval of key/value pairs. This project is designed to provide a robust way to manage pairs of related data, enabling users to efficiently look up values based on their corresponding keys. Associative arrays are commonly used to implement Dictionary or Map types, providing essential functionalities for modern programming.
