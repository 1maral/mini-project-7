# Project Title: Abstract Games - ATTACKERS
==================

**Author**
* Maral Bat-Erdene
* Benjamin Sheeley

This project makes a game called "Attackers" in the terminal, making use of the matrix class from Samuel Rebelsky's Mini-Project 6 assignment. This game takes inspiration from games such as Galaga or Space Invaders, with the player determining the board size rather than there being a constant board size.
